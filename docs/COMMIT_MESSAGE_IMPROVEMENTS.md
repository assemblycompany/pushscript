# Commit Message Improvements

## Problem Description

Users were experiencing one-liner commit messages that lacked detail and didn't fully reflect the changes made to the code. The AI-generated commit messages were:

- **Too brief** - Only single-line messages without context
- **Missing details** - No explanation of what was changed or why
- **Lacking impact** - No description of the effects of the changes
- **Generic** - Not specific enough to understand the actual changes

## Root Cause Analysis

After thorough investigation, several critical issues were identified:

### 1. **Extremely Low Token Limits**
The most critical issue was in `src/index.js`:
```javascript
maxTokens = 100; // Lower for gemini to reduce likelihood of issues
```

**This was severely limiting AI responses to only 100 tokens!** This is why users were getting one-liners instead of detailed descriptions.

### 2. **Overly Restrictive Prompt Instructions**
In `src/providers.js`:
```javascript
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the commit message text. Do NOT use markdown formatting, code blocks, backticks, or any other formatting. Return plain text only.
```

This instruction was **too restrictive** and may have been causing the AI to be overly concise.

### 3. **Default Commit Style Emphasized Brevity**
The default commit style in `src/utils/pushscript-config.js` emphasized:
- "concise"
- "brief but informative"
- "Keep it brief"

This was contributing to the problem by encouraging minimal responses.

### 4. **Aggressive Diff Optimization**
The diff optimization in `src/token-utils.js` was designed to reduce tokens, but it might have been removing too much context.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Increased Token Limits**
```javascript
// Before
maxTokens = 100; // Too restrictive

// After  
maxTokens = 300; // Increased to allow for more detailed commit messages
```

**Impact**: AI can now generate up to 300 tokens (3x more), allowing for detailed multi-line commit messages.

### 2. **Enhanced Prompt Instructions**
```javascript
// Before
IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the commit message text. Do NOT use markdown formatting...

// After
IMPORTANT: Create a detailed commit message that explains the changes clearly. You may include a brief description after the first line if needed. Do NOT use markdown formatting...
```

**Impact**: AI is now encouraged to provide more detailed explanations.

### 3. **Improved Default Commit Style**
```javascript
// Before
commit_style: `As a senior developer, create a concise git commit message...
Focus on the key changes and their purpose. Keep it brief but informative.`

// After
commit_style: `As a senior developer, create a detailed and informative git commit message...
Focus on explaining what was changed, why it was changed, and the impact of the changes.`
```

**Impact**: The default style now encourages detailed, informative messages with examples.

### 4. **Enhanced Diff Optimization**
```javascript
// Before
// Aggressive: Keep only +/- lines and hunk headers
return diff.split('\n')
  .filter(line => line.startsWith('@') || line.startsWith('+') || line.startsWith('-'))
  .join('\n');

// After
// Keep +/- lines, hunk headers, and some context for better understanding
return diff.split('\n')
  .filter(line => line.startsWith('@') || line.startsWith('+') || line.startsWith('-') || line.startsWith(' '))
  .join('\n');
```

**Impact**: More context is preserved in the diff, giving AI better understanding of changes.

### 5. **New AI Configuration System**
Added a new configuration section for fine-tuning AI behavior:
```javascript
ai: {
  max_tokens: 300,
  allow_multiline: true,
  prefer_detailed: true
}
```

**Impact**: Users can now customize AI behavior through configuration files.

## Examples of Improvements

### Before (One-liner)
```
feat(ui): add button component
```

### After (Detailed)
```
feat(ui): add loading state to button component
  Implement loading spinner and disabled state for better UX
  Add variant prop to support different button styles
  Include accessibility attributes for screen readers
```

### Before (Generic)
```
fix: resolve bug
```

### After (Specific)
```
fix(auth): resolve race condition in user session updates
  Prevent data corruption when multiple requests modify user state
  Add proper locking mechanism to session management
  Include error handling for edge cases
```

## Configuration Options

Users can now customize commit message generation through `.pushscript.json`:

```json
{
  "ai": {
    "max_tokens": 400,
    "allow_multiline": true,
    "prefer_detailed": true
  },
  "commit_style": "As a fintech expert, create detailed commit messages focusing on business impact and technical precision.",
  "validation": {
    "max_length": 100
  }
}
```

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were added to verify the improvements:

- **Token limit validation** - Ensures reasonable token limits (300-500)
- **Commit style verification** - Confirms new style encourages detail
- **AI configuration testing** - Validates new configuration system
- **Diff optimization testing** - Ensures context preservation

## Impact

These improvements will result in:

1. **More informative commit messages** - Users will understand what changed and why
2. **Better project history** - Detailed commit messages improve codebase documentation
3. **Enhanced collaboration** - Team members can better understand changes
4. **Improved debugging** - Detailed commit messages help with troubleshooting
5. **Better compliance** - More detailed messages satisfy conventional commit requirements

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing configurations continue to work
- Default behavior is improved but not breaking
- Users can still customize behavior through configuration files
- Token limits are capped for safety to prevent API issues

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements for future versions:
- **Commit message templates** - Predefined templates for common change types
- **Context-aware generation** - AI considers project history and patterns
- **Multi-language support** - Support for different natural languages
- **Integration with issue trackers** - Link commits to issues and pull requests
