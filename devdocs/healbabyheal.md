No, keeping the wrapper (pushscript.cjs) is still the right call—we just don’t want it forcing installs for every npm user.

How it fits the open-source plan

Part	Role	OK for public npm?
pushscript.cjs (wrapper)	• Ensures .gitignore exists.
• Optionally kicks the dependency-manager when PUSHSCRIPT_SELF_HEAL=true.
• Delegates to the real CLI.	✅ Yes—ship it as the bin entry.
dependency-manager.cjs	Installs missing deps only when the env-flag is set (self-healing clones, offline demos, etc.).	✅ Safe, because default is off.
gitignore-manager.cjs	One-time nicety; no network calls.	✅ Fine.

What to change in package.json

{
  "bin": { "pushscript": "./pushscript.cjs" },
  "type": "module",              // keep for ESM files
  "exports": "./cli.js",         // optional, for direct imports
  "engines": { "node": ">=18" }
}
Result

npm / npx users: run instantly; no hidden installs because SELF_HEAL is unset.

Git-clone tinkerers: can opt-in with export PUSHSCRIPT_SELF_HEAL=true and let the dependency manager do its thing.

Wrapper still guarantees the gitignore check and a clean hand-off to cli-runner.cjs.

So the wrapper stays—just keep the self-healing flag off by default, and you’re good.






You said:
yes  self-healing only if setting is true which won't be unless set manually

Perfect—that strikes the right balance:

Default path (npm / npx) → wrapper runs, skips self-healing, launches instantly.

Opt-in path → user sets PUSHSCRIPT_SELF_HEAL=true, wrapper installs any missing deps.

Just add two tiny touches:

# If you cloned the repo and skipped npm install:
export PUSHSCRIPT_SELF_HEAL=true   # one-time
npx pushscript

“🔧 Need auto-install? Set PUSHSCRIPT_SELF_HEAL=true”

Then ship—it’s clean, predictable, and won’t surprise standard npm users.
