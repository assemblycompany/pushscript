GitContext: AI-Powered Context Management for Developers
Tired of starting from scratch with every new coding session? GitContext seamlessly maintains your development narrative.
GitContext automatically builds and updates a comprehensive knowledge base of your codebase with every commit. By analyzing code changes in real-time, it creates a living document that any AI assistant can instantly understand—eliminating the need to repeatedly explain your project structure.
Our smart git hooks integrate with your existing workflow, transforming commit messages into contextual intelligence that evolves with your project. No more lost context between development sessions or team handoffs.
GitContext: Because your code has a story, and your AI assistant should know it.

"Just shipped a game-changer for AI-assisted dev workflows: @context
Fed up with your AI assistant forgetting your codebase between sessions? We built a git-integrated context generator that maintains a living understanding of your project. Commit code, update context. Type @context and your assistant instantly knows what's what. No more wasting tokens on repetitive codebase walkthroughs.
It's shaving hours off our sprint cycles. The 10x engineer isn't the one writing more code—it's the one optimizing their workflow. "
