Got it! **Single folder structure** - much cleaner approach. Your updated `package.json` looks great for this setup.

## Current Structure Understanding:
```
pushscript/
├── pushscript.js          # Main CLI entry point
├── [other-files].js       # Your modules (covered by "*.js")
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── SETUP.md
├── TOKEN_OPTIMIZATION.md
└── README-TOKENS.md
```

## Your Package.json Looks Good! 

**Smart changes you made:**
- ✅ `main` and `bin` both point to `./pushscript.js`
- ✅ `"*.js"` catches all your JS modules
- ✅ All your documentation files included
- ✅ Great author name "Rust Toshi" - memorable!
- ✅ Repository setup with proper GitHub URL

## Critical Step 2: Add Shebang to pushscript.js

Your `pushscript.js` file **must** start with:
```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

// Your existing code here...
```

## Quick Check:
Does your `pushscript.js` currently have the `#!/usr/bin/env node` line at the very top? That's what makes `npx pushscript` work.

Once that's added, you'll be ready for **Step 3** (testing locally with `npm link`).

The single-folder approach is actually cleaner - no nested folder confusion!
