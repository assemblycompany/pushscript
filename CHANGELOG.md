## [0.2.7] - 2025-07-12

### Fixed
- **Critical Gemini Shell Error Fix**: Resolved shell errors when using Gemini provider
  - Fixed "unexpected EOF while looking for matching" errors caused by backticks in AI responses
  - Enhanced response sanitization to remove markdown code blocks and backticks
  - Improved shell character escaping for git commit commands
  - Added comprehensive logging and debugging for troubleshooting
  - Updated Gemini prompt to explicitly request plain text responses

### Added
- **Enhanced Response Sanitization**: 
  - Removes entire code blocks (```...```) from AI responses
  - Strips all backticks and markdown formatting
  - Normalizes newlines and whitespace
  - Additional validation for edge cases
- **Improved Shell Safety**: 
  - Better character escaping for quotes, backticks, dollar signs, and backslashes
  - Removal of non-printable characters
  - Command logging for debugging
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 
  - Added tests for real-world problematic responses
  - Verified fix works with exact error scenarios from user reports

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Gemini was returning responses with markdown code blocks containing backticks, which were interpreted as command substitution by the shell
- **Solution**: Multi-layered approach combining prompt engineering, response sanitization, and shell safety measures
- **Impact**: Resolves critical issue preventing users from committing with Gemini provider

## [0.2.1] - 2025-01-01

### Fixed
- **Major API Reliability Improvements**: Fixed persistent 503 "model overloaded" errors
  - Added automatic retry logic with exponential backoff for temporary API failures
  - Implemented proper rate limiting enforcement to prevent hitting API limits
  - Improved error handling to distinguish between retryable and permanent failures
  - Reduced verbose logging that could cause issues in production environments

### Changed
- **Enhanced Gemini API Integration**:
  - Removed automatic API key format fixing that could cause authentication issues
  - Added proper API key validation with helpful warnings
  - Improved rate limiting to actually wait for limits instead of just warning
  - Optimized request body logging to prevent overwhelming output

### Added
- **New Troubleshooting Documentation**: Added comprehensive guide for API-related issues
- **Retry Mechanism**: API requests now automatically retry up to 3 times for 503 errors
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Automatically waits for rate limits (up to 10 seconds) to prevent errors
