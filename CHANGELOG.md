## [0.2.12] - 2025-07-16

### Fixed
- **Commit Message Indentation**: Fixed overly indented commit message body lines that appeared muted
  - **Issue**: Commit message descriptions were being displayed with excessive indentation (4-6 spaces), making them hard to read

  - **Result**: Commit message descriptions now display clearly and are easy to read while maintaining visual hierarchy

### Enhanced

## [0.2.11] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed

  - **Solution**: Updated the commit message display logic to properly format multi-line messages with indentation
  - **Result**: Commit messages now display with proper formatting, making them much easier to read and review

- **User Experience**: Users can now easily read and review detailed commit messages before confirming the push

## [0.2.10] - 2025-07-14

### Fixed
- **Gemini Response Sanitization Bug**: Fixed critical issue where AI-generated commit messages were being incorrectly rejected due to improper markdown sanitization
  - **Root Cause**: The sanitization logic was removing entire code block content instead of just markdown formatting
  - **Impact**: Valid conventional commit messages like `feat(data): implement smart data fetching` were being rejected with "does not match conventional format" error
  - **Solution**: Updated sanitization to preserve content while removing only markdown formatting (````text`, ````, backticks)
  - **Result**: AI-generated commit messages now pass validation correctly and are properly committed

### Technical Details
- **Regex Fix**: Changed from `/```[\s\S]*?```/g` (removes entire content) to `/```\w*\n?/g` and `/```\n?/g` (removes only formatting)
- **Content Preservation**: Commit message content is now preserved while markdown artifacts are removed
- **Test Updates**: Updated all sanitization tests to reflect new behavior where content is preserved
- **Backward Compatibility**: No breaking changes; existing functionality remains intact

## [0.2.9] - 2025-07-12

### Fixed
- **Commit Message Verbosity Balance**: Refined AI prompt to produce balanced commit messages
  - Adjusted Gemini provider prompt to encourage clear and informative but concise messages
  - Changed from "1-2 sentences" to "1-3 sentences" for explanation flexibility
  - Maintained detailed descriptions while preventing excessive verbosity
  - Result: Commit messages are now informative yet appropriately concise

## [0.2.8] - 2025-07-12

### Fixed
- **Enhanced AI Commit Message Quality**: Significantly improved the informativeness and detail of AI-generated commit messages
  - Increased maxTokens from 100 to 300 to allow for more detailed responses
  - Softened restrictive prompt instructions to encourage comprehensive descriptions
  - Updated default commit style to emphasize detailed, informative messages with examples
  - Improved diff optimization to preserve more context for better AI analysis
  - Added AI configuration section for customizable token limits and message preferences

### Added
- **AI Configuration Options**: 
  - `maxTokens` setting (default: 300) for controlling response length
  - `messageDetail` preference for fine-tuning detail level
  - Provider-specific token management improvements
- **Enhanced Prompt Engineering**:

  - Better examples and formatting guidance
  - Improved context preservation in diff processing
- **Better Message Quality**: 
  - Commit messages now include detailed descriptions of changes
  - Better categorization and scope identification
  - More informative explanations of what and why changes were made

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Previous settings were too restrictive, limiting AI responses to brief one-liners
- **Solution**: Multi-faceted approach combining increased token limits, improved prompts, and better diff processing
- **Impact**: Users now receive much more informative and detailed commit messages that better explain their changes

## [0.2.7] - 2025-07-12

### Fixed

- **Solution**: Multi-layered approach combining prompt engineering, response sanitization, and shell safety measures
- **Impact**: Resolves critical issue preventing users from committing with Gemini provider
